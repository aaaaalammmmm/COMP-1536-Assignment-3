<!--
QUICK-GUIDELINE

-Your solution must be based on the HTML5 canvas control
-The size of your canvas must be 300px – 500px wide and 300px – 500px high
-The house in your canvas must appear to be 3-dimentional
-You must animate the smoke billowing out of the chimney
-You must add a range control that either slows down the animation or makes it go faster.
-The smoke animation should look natural and realistic
-The animation should be continuous and only stops when the web page is closed
-You are not allowed to simply add an image to the background of the canvas. This means that you
must draw the house & smoke and subsequently fill them with appropriate colors using standard
functions associated with the canvas control.
- Your web page should be named index.html.
- Be creative and ensure that your drawing is colorful and neat looking.
- All JavaScript and CSS must be placed in files external to your web page.
- Put the names (LastName, FirstName format) of team members in the page <title> tag.
- Your web page should not be bland. Add a suitable header and, instead of a readme.txt file, add
content to your index.html page with the following information:
- Your names, student numbers, email addresses, and set
- What you have completed & what you have not completed
- Any major challenges
- The best mark will be given to the most artistic solution with realistic smoke.

                <p>We used requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval, which was quite challenging to get working. We also encountered various issues with having the value of the range slider update the speed of the animation. Also, we had to figure out where some variables should be declared and assigned, for them to work properly.</p>
