<!--
QUICK-GUIDELINE

-Your solution must be based on the HTML5 canvas control
-The size of your canvas must be 300px – 500px wide and 300px – 500px high
-The house in your canvas must appear to be 3-dimentional
-You must animate the smoke billowing out of the chimney
-You must add a range control that either slows down the animation or makes it go faster.
-The smoke animation should look natural and realistic
-The animation should be continuous and only stops when the web page is closed
-You are not allowed to simply add an image to the background of the canvas. This means that you
must draw the house & smoke and subsequently fill them with appropriate colors using standard
functions associated with the canvas control.
- Your web page should be named index.html.
- Be creative and ensure that your drawing is colorful and neat looking.
- All JavaScript and CSS must be placed in files external to your web page.
- Put the names (LastName, FirstName format) of team members in the page <title> tag.
- Your web page should not be bland. Add a suitable header and, instead of a readme.txt file, add
content to your index.html page with the following information:
- Your names, student numbers, email addresses, and set
- What you have completed & what you have not completed
- Any major challenges
- The best mark will be given to the most artistic solution with realistic smoke.
