                <p>All criteria of the assignment have been fulfilled to the best of our knowledge.</p>
                <p>We used requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval, which was quite challenging to get working. We also encountered various issues with having the value of the range slider update the speed of the animation. Also, we had to figure out where some variables should be declared and assigned, for them to work properly.</p>
